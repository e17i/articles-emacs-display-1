<h2 id="orgc9d8612">TL;DR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc9d8612">
<p>
A topic of long and outstanding troubles for me has been the automatic
selection of the <i>other window</i> in emacs. As soon as an info buffer is shown,
the current window is split or another, already existing window is
selected to show the buffer. This is no problem when there is only
one window in the current frame, but if you split your frame
into a carefully crafted set of windows, the next info buffer will
most often annoy by appearing in one of those windows. So I tried to
solve the question on how to change this behaviour.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org10bf256" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org10bf256">Handling of other window</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org10bf256">
<p>
First, what is this <i>other window</i>? When you are working in emacs,
typically all your navigation or modification commands are executed in
the current window (the one the cursor mark is in). Besides that,
there can be another special window, which you can also modify
indirectly (e.g. with <code>C-M-v</code> to scroll). Often, this other window pops
up to show info buffers activated with functions like <code>describe-key</code>
or <code>describe-function</code>. 
</p>

<p>
Now, as it seems, this selection mechanism of the other window is
actually a quite deterministic operation. Its frontend is
<code>pop-to-buffer</code> and documentation is in <code>display-buffer</code>. Its
behaviour is controlled by some variables
(<code>display-buffer-fallback-action</code>, <code>display-buffer-base-action</code> etc),
which define a priorized list of actions. There, a range of
<code>display-buffer-functions</code> can be combined, generating this
behaviour. When displaying a new buffer, each of these
functions will be called. Each one now uses its own strategy to decide if
there is an existing window or if a new window can be split to display
the buffer. Each one also can step back and leave it to the following
one to take the decision.
</p>

<p>
So the first idea mitigating the problem might be to sensibly change
the action list defined in <code>display-buffer-fallback-action</code>,
overriding it in <code>display-buffer-base-action</code>. Here I just replace
the <code>display-buffer-use-some-window</code> function, which obviously is the
source of this erratic behaviour. My replacement is a combination of
<code>display-buffer-below-selected</code> and <code>display-buffer-at-bottom</code>.
After a while of testing this, it seems to be not such a bad
selection, at least for frames using a
large screen space. This way, windows for occur or magit, which you want
to pop up on the fly, are put below the window you are working in
currently. Other windows further down or at the sides are left
untouched.
</p>

<p>
But you also need to make sure windows are not split if too small.
When this happens the last action comes in, <code>display-buffer-pop-up-frame</code>,
which will open a new frame to display the buffer. In my opinion, this
is still better as a last resort than to change my window layout.
</p>

<p>
The configuration looks loke this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(custom-set-variables
 '(display-buffer-base-action
   '((display-buffer-maybe-as-scroll-buffer display-buffer-dedicated-window display-buffer--maybe-same-window display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer--maybe-pop-up-frame-or-window display-buffer-in-previous-window display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom display-buffer-pop-up-frame)))
 '(window-min-height 8)
 '(window-min-width 40))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The actions in this list do things like checking if the buffer
already had been displayed in a still existing window and then re-using
that window. Otherwise, they try to split a window below the current
one or, if there is not enough place, at the frame's bottom.
</p>

<p>
To avoid opening a new frame, for example if your current one is
already cluttered with small windows, I've added a function to
temporarily edit with original behaviour.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">edit-with-fallback-display</span> ()

  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">interactive</span>)
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">let</span> ((display-buffer-base-action nil))
    (recursive-edit)))

<div id="outline-container-org890d00d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org890d00d">Help and Apropos buffers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org890d00d">
<p>
Help and apropos buffers should not go into a magit or occur window,
but into their own. So, I've added another configuration for them.
Recognized by a regex, they receive a special list of display actions and
also some attributes modifying the window size. I want to put those
buffers into a window at bottom, where they are unobtrusive and can
stay as long as I want. If such a window already exists, it should be
reused. The given <code>display-height</code> attribute
makes sure the window (also if reused) is shrunk to the size of it's actual
contents. If it needs to be widened instead, this is done at max to
half of the frame size. This way, describing functions or variables
can be repeated as often as wished and the description always goes
into the same window, resizing it as needed.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(custom-set-variables
 '(display-buffer-alist
   '((<span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\*Help\\*</span><span style="color: #8b2252; font-weight: bold;">\\</span><span style="color: #8b2252; font-weight: bold;">|</span><span style="color: #8b2252;">\\*Apropos\\*"</span>
      (display-buffer-as-scroll-buffer display-buffer-dedicated-window display-buffer-reuse-help display-buffer-at-bottom)
      (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer-max-half-frame)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The function <code>display-buffer-reuse-help</code> uses a configurable regex to
see if there is already a help window visible. If one is found, that
one is used to show the new help buffer. Also, if a window height
function is given, it is applied to adopt the size of the re-used
window.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defcustom</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">help-buffer-regex</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\*Help\\*</span><span style="color: #8b2252; font-weight: bold;">\\</span><span style="color: #8b2252; font-weight: bold;">|</span><span style="color: #8b2252;">\\*Apropos\\*"</span>

                   (window-list)))))
    (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (<span style="color: #a020f0;">and</span> wnd (window-live-p wnd))

        (<span style="color: #a020f0;">ignore-errors</span> (funcall height window)))
    window))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, the <code>window-height</code> action attribute specified in the
configuration above uses a custom function
<code>fit-window-to-buffer-max-half-frame</code>. It calls <code>fit-window-to-buffer</code>
to narrow the window to its new contents or, if widening it instead,
use the halve frame height as max height.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">fit-window-to-buffer-max-half-frame</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">&amp;optional</span> window)
  <span style="color: #8b2252;">"fit window to buffer size, but use max half of current frame height."</span>
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">interactive</span>)
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">let</span> ((wnd (<span style="color: #a020f0;">or</span> window (selected-window)))
        (max-height (/ (frame-height) 2)))
    (fit-window-to-buffer window max-height)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now try this and repeatedly call <code>describe-function</code> for different
functions. The first call opens a help window, each following call
changes its size and updates it. For me, this works nicely.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgec9c3f5">
<p>
Ths can be continued to apply special behavious for example to dired
windows. And the more you customize this, the more you also want a
more fine grained "remote" control of the other window, i.e. by augmenting the
set of <code>C-x 4</code> keys. In the next post I'm showing what I've done so far..
