<h2 id="orga8d696c">TL;DR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga8d696c">
<p>
A topic of long and outstanding troubles for me has been the automatic
selection of the <i>other window</i> in emacs. As soon as an info buffer is shown,
the current window is split or another, already existing window is
selected to show the buffer. This is no problem when there is only
one window in the current frame, but if you split your frame
into a carefully crafted set of windows, the next info buffer will
most often annoy by appearing in one of those windows. So I tried to
solve the question on how to change this behaviour.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org14845bd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org14845bd">Handling of other window</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org14845bd">
<p>
First, what is this <i>other window</i>? When you are working in emacs,
typically all your navigation or modification commands are executed in
the current window (the one the cursor mark is in). Besides that,
there can be another special window, which you can also modify
indirectly (e.g. with <code>C-M-v</code> to scroll). Often, this other window pops
up to show info buffers activated with functions like <code>describe-key</code>
or <code>describe-function</code>. 
</p>

<p>
At the beginning, I had three ideas to handle this: pushing an
annoying buffer into its own frame, explicitly selecting a window
where the next buffer should appear and modifying the default
selection strategy. I implemented all three to see which one works
best.
</p>

<p>
Now, as it seems, the selection mechanism of the other window is
actually a quite deterministic operation. Its frontend is
<code>pop-to-buffer</code> and documentation is in <code>display-buffer</code>. Its
behaviour is controlled by some variables
(<code>display-buffer-fallback-action</code>, <code>display-buffer-base-action</code> etc),
which define a priorized list of actions. There, a range of
<code>display-buffer-functions</code> can be combined, generating this
behaviour. When displaying a new buffer, each of these
functions will be called. Each one now uses its own strategy to decide if
there is an existing window or if a new window can be split to display
the buffer. Each one also can step back and leave it to the following
one to take the decision.
</p>

<p>
So the most promising idea mitigating the problem probably is to sensibly change
the action list defined in <code>display-buffer-fallback-action</code>,
overriding it in <code>display-buffer-base-action</code>. I did this, just replacing
the <code>display-buffer-use-some-window</code> function, which obviously is the
source of this erratic behaviour. My replacement is a combination of
<code>display-buffer-below-selected</code> and <code>display-buffer-at-bottom</code>.
After a while of testing this, it seems to be not such a bad
selection, at least for frames using a
large screen space. This way, e.g. windows for occur or magit, which you want
to pop up on the fly, are put below the window you are working in
currently. Other windows further down or at the sides are left
untouched.
</p>

<p>
But you also need to make sure windows are not split if too small.
When this happens the last action comes in, <code>display-buffer-pop-up-frame</code>,
which will open a new frame to display the buffer. In my opinion, this
is still better as a last resort than to change my window layout.
</p>

<p>
The configuration looks loke this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(custom-set-variables
 '(display-buffer-base-action
   '((display-buffer--maybe-same-window display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer--maybe-pop-up-frame-or-window display-buffer-in-previous-window display-buffer-below-selected display-buffer-at-bottom display-buffer-pop-up-frame)))
 '(window-min-height 8)
 '(window-min-width 40))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The actions in this list do things like checking if the buffer
already had been displayed; if that window is still existing, then re-using
it. Otherwise, they try to split a window below the current
one or, if there is not enough place, at the frame's bottom.
</p>

<p>
To avoid opening a new frame, for example if your current one is
already cluttered with small windows, I've added a function to
temporarily edit with original behaviour.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">edit-with-fallback-display</span> ()

<span style="color: #8b2252;">  have the original buffer sharing behaviour."</span>
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">interactive</span>)
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">let</span> ((display-buffer-base-action nil))
    (recursive-edit)))

<div id="outline-container-orgb19ab16" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb19ab16">Help and Apropos buffers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb19ab16">
<p>
Help and apropos buffers should not go into a magit or occur window
probably visible, but always into their own. So, I've added another
configuration for them. Recognized by a regex, they receive a special
list of display actions and also an attribute modifying the window
size. I want to put those buffers into a window at bottom, where they
are unobtrusive and can stay as long as I want. If such a window
already exists, it should be reused. The given <code>display-height</code>
attribute makes sure the window (also if reused) is shrunk to the size
of it's new contents. If it needs to be widened instead, this is done
at max to half of the frame size. This way, describing functions or
variables can be repeated as often as wished and the description
always goes into the same window, resizing it as needed.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(custom-set-variables
 '(display-buffer-alist
   '((<span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\*Help\\*</span><span style="color: #8b2252; font-weight: bold;">\\</span><span style="color: #8b2252; font-weight: bold;">|</span><span style="color: #8b2252;">\\*Apropos\\*"</span>
      (display-buffer-reuse-help display-buffer-at-bottom)
      (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer-max-half-frame)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The function <code>display-buffer-reuse-help</code> uses a configurable regex to
see if there is already a help window visible. If one is found, that
one is used to show the new help buffer. Also, if a window height
function is given, it is applied to adopt the size of the re-used
window.
</p>

<p>
Note this configurable regex looks the same as the selector regex in
the <code>display-buffer-alist</code>. But the selector triggers an action when a
new buffer with this name should be displayed, while the second one is
used to recognize and re-use a window already existing.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defcustom</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">help-buffer-regex</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\*Help\\*</span><span style="color: #8b2252; font-weight: bold;">\\</span><span style="color: #8b2252; font-weight: bold;">|</span><span style="color: #8b2252;">\\*Apropos\\*"</span>

    (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (<span style="color: #a020f0;">and</span> wnd (window-live-p wnd))
        (window-update-buffer buffer wnd 'reuse alist))))

        (<span style="color: #a020f0;">ignore-errors</span> (funcall height window)))
    window))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, the <code>window-height</code> action attribute specified in the
configuration above uses a custom function
<code>fit-window-to-buffer-max-half-frame</code>. It calls <code>fit-window-to-buffer</code>
to narrow the window to its new contents or, if widening it instead,
uses half of the frame height as max height.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">fit-window-to-buffer-max-half-frame</span> (<span style="color: #228b22;">&amp;optional</span> window)
  <span style="color: #8b2252;">"fit window to buffer size, but use max half of current frame height."</span>
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">interactive</span>)
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">let</span> ((wnd (<span style="color: #a020f0;">or</span> window (selected-window)))
        (max-height (/ (frame-height) 2)))
    (fit-window-to-buffer window max-height)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now try this and repeatedly call <code>describe-function</code> for different
functions. The first call opens a help window, each following call
changes its size and updates it. For me, this works nicely.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org02fd4b5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org02fd4b5">Explicitly selecting a window</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org02fd4b5">
<p>
As a second way to solve my problem, I implemented a function to
dedicate a selected window for the next buffer to appear in. This way,
you can create a window outside of your working environment, dedicate
it and then from your main window call magit, occur or describe to appear there.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defvar</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">dedicated-other-window</span> nil)

<span style="color: #8b2252;">window and reverts to the default window selection behaviour. Default is a</span>
<span style="color: #8b2252;">one-time dedication, use =C-u= for unlimited."</span>
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">interactive</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"p"</span>)
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">setq</span> dedicated-other-window
        (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (eq arg 0)
            nil
          (selected-window)))
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">setq</span> dedication-count
        (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (eq 4 arg) nil arg))
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> dedicated-other-window
      (message <span style="color: #8b2252;">"window dedicated"</span>)
    (message <span style="color: #8b2252;">"dedication removed"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To activate this, put <code>display-buffer-dedicated-window</code> at the
beginning of your <code>display-buffer-base-action</code> (and also into
<code>display-buffer-alist</code> or whereever you need it).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">display-buffer-dedicated-window</span> (buffer alist)
  <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Display pop-up-buffer in the dedicated other window, if one is</span>
<span style="color: #8b2252;">selected. If none is selected, revert to the default behaviour."</span>
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (<span style="color: #a020f0;">and</span> dedicated-other-window
           (window-live-p dedicated-other-window))
      (<span style="color: #a020f0;">prog1</span>
          (window-update-buffer buffer dedicated-other-window 'reuse alist)
        (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (<span style="color: #a020f0;">and</span> dedication-count (&gt; dedication-count 0))
            (<span style="color: #a020f0;">setq</span> dedication-count (- dedication-count 1)))
        (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (eq 0 dedication-count)
            (<span style="color: #a020f0;">setq</span> dedicated-other-window nil)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>prog1</code> makes sure the result of <code>window-update-buffer</code> (the
window actually used or nil) is returned, indicating if this action
has selected a window or if the next one should do it.
</p>

<p>
If you bind <code>dedicate-window</code> to a convenient key, this way of
selecting which window to use as the next other window is not too clumsy.

<h2 id="org08c4632">Push buffer to own frame</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org08c4632">
<p>
Finally, if it is too late and a window already did pop up inside of your working
environment, you can select it and use this function to push it out
into a new frame. As it seems, this works with an emacs running on mac
or windows, but not on X11. I'll have another look at this..

<div class="org-src-container">

        (selected (selected-window)))
    (<span style="color: #a020f0;">if</span> (display-buffer-other-frame current)
        (quit-restore-window selected))))

<p>
Now I'll see how these three ways are helping. So far, the most
promising one seems to be the way of modifying the automatic display
strategies. Of course, it is also the most expensive one. The two
changes shown above (general change and specific change for
info/apropos buffers) can be continued to apply special behavious for
example also to dired, occur, deadgrep, magit windows. And the more
you customize this, the more you also want a more fine grained
"remote" control of the other window, i.e. by augmenting the set of
<code>C-x 4</code> keys. In the next post I'm continuing to show what I've done
so far..
